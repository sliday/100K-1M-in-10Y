# From $100k to $1M in 10 Years

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

This project started from a simple thought: what happens after you achieve your first financial milestone? Once you've saved up your first $100k through hard work and smart financial choices, the next challenge becomes making that money work for you. Should you buy property? Invest in stocks? Try crypto? Move to a tax-friendly country? Buy gold?

*Inspired by [this Twitter thread](https://x.com/stas_kulesh/status/1875537324576317887) about the need for a practical investment guide after reaching initial financial independence.*

The goal here is to provide a practical, honest investment blueprint that could help grow $100k into $1M over about 10 years. It's the guide I wish existed when I first faced these questions. We'll explore everything from traditional ETFs to modern crypto investments, with a strong focus on risk management and practical implementation.

This isn't about get-rich-quick schemes or complex financial instruments. Instead, it's a systematic approach combining proven investment strategies with newer opportunities, all explained in plain English with real examples.

## The Journey from $100k to $1M

Let's talk about where you are and where you're going. You've built a business or saved diligently, and now you have $100,000 in cash. That's a significant achievement, but it's also a crossroads. Here's the reality:

- $100k is not enough to retire on. Depending on your location, it might give you 1-4 years of runway without work.
- You have limited time - typically 20-30 years of peak productive adult life.
- Time is working against your cash - inflation will eat away at its value if you don't put it to work.

Why $1M as a target? Let's be clear: one million dollars is not "FU money". It's not extreme wealth in today's world. But it is:
- A solid foundation for financial security
- More capital than most people ever accumulate
- Enough to generate meaningful passive income
- A proof that you understand wealth building

Most importantly, the journey from $100k to $1M teaches you everything you need to know about growing wealth. By the time you reach $1M, you'll have:
- Mastered risk management
- Understood market cycles
- Built strong investment habits
- Developed financial intuition

This guide stops at $1M because the path from $1M to $10M (true "FU money") is a different game entirely. But here's the thing: if you can turn $100k into $1M, you'll have all the skills needed to reach $10M on your own. We genuinely believe that.
