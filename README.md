# $100k → $1M in 10Y: A Practical Investment Journey

*This guide was inspired by [this discussion](https://x.com/stas_kulesh/status/1875537324576317887) about the need for practical investment guidance after reaching initial financial independence.*

## Situation: The $100k Milestone

Congratulations! You've reached a significant milestone - your first $100,000. Whether through building a business, saving from your salary, or a combination of both, you've proven you can build wealth. But now comes the harder question: how do you make that money work for you?

You might be:
- A professional who's been saving diligently for years
- An entrepreneur who's had a successful exit
- Someone who's inherited or received a windfall
- A couple combining their savings for a better future

The challenge? $100k is both a lot and not enough:
- It's more than what most people globally manage to save in their lifetime. It's more than 70% of Americans have in savings
- Yet it's not enough to retire on (1-4 years of expenses in most places)
- Inflation will eat away at it if left in cash
- Traditional advice often stops at "buy index funds"

## Task: Growing to $1M Systematically

Our goal is clear but challenging: turn $100,000 into $1,000,000 in about 10 years. This means:
- Starting with $100,000 in capital
- Contributing $2,000 monthly from income
- Achieving roughly 17% annual returns
- Managing risks to protect your capital

Why $1M? It's not "never work again" money, but it is:
- A foundation for real financial security
- Enough to generate meaningful passive income ($40-50k/year)
- Proof that you understand wealth building
- A springboard to even greater wealth

Most importantly, the journey teaches you everything about growing wealth:
- Risk management
- Market cycles
- Investment psychology
- Financial independence

## Portfolio Allocation

Our strategy employs a barbell approach, balancing growth potential with stability:

```
Core Growth (70%):
ETFs:         35% ($35,000 + $700/mo) - Market exposure
Crypto:       35% ($35,000 + $700/mo) - Digital assets

Stability (25%):
Term Deps:    15% ($15,000 + $300/mo) - Fixed-rate returns
Bonds:        10% ($10,000 + $200/mo) - Government securities

Yield Enhancement (5%):
DeFi:          5% ($5,000 + $100/mo)  - Yield farming

Monthly Investment: $2,000 total
Initial Capital:    $100,000 total
```

Each allocation serves a specific purpose:
- ETFs: Broad market exposure through index funds
- Crypto: Digital asset appreciation potential
- Term Deposits: Stable, predictable returns
- Bonds: Portfolio stabilization
- DeFi: Enhanced yields through crypto platforms

## Action: The Implementation Blueprint

Start with security and infrastructure:
```
