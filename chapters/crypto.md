## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Core Investment Mistakes
1. FOMO Buying
   - Example: Buying $10,000 SOL after 300% pump
   - Impact: Buying local top, immediate 50% drawdown
   - Better Approach: Stick to DCA plan ($60/month into SOL)
   - Real Numbers: $10,000 rushed entry vs $720 yearly DCA exposure

2. Overtrading
   - Example: Day trading entire $20,000 BTC position
   - Impact: High fees, tax events, missed long-term gains
   - Better Approach: 80% cold storage, 20% trading
   - Real Numbers: $100/day in fees = $36,500/year wasted

3. Poor Security
   - Example: Keeping $40,000 crypto allocation on exchange
   - Impact: Exchange hack risk, potential total loss
   - Better Approach: 80% ($32,000) in cold storage
   - Real Numbers: Historical exchange hacks average 30% loss ($12,000)

### Technical Mistakes
1. Wallet Management
   - Example: Single seed phrase for $40,000 portfolio
   - Impact: Single point of failure risk
   - Better Approach: Split between 2-3 hardware wallets
   - Real Numbers: Max loss limited to 50% ($20,000) per wallet

2. Network Fees
   - Example: Moving $1,000 ETH during 500 gwei gas
   - Impact: $150 transaction fee (15% loss)
   - Better Approach: Wait for <50 gwei ($15 fee)
   - Real Numbers: Save $135 per transaction

### Strategic Mistakes
1. Poor Position Sizing
   - Example: $10,000 (25%) allocation to AVAX
   - Impact: Over-exposure to Layer 1 risk
   - Better Approach: Max 2% ($2,000) per alt
   - Real Numbers: Limit potential alt loss to $800 (40% drop)

2. Ignoring Market Cycles
   - Example: Full $40,000 deployment in bull market peak
   - Impact: Potential 80% drawdown ($32,000 loss)
   - Better Approach: Scale in over 6 months
   - Real Numbers: Average entry price 30% better = $12,000 saved

### Implementation Mistakes
1. Poor Entry Strategy
   - Example: Market buying $20,000 BTC at once
   - Impact: No room for dips, poor average price
   - Better Approach: 40-30-30 split over 60 days
   - Real Numbers: Save 10% on entry = $2,000

2. Staking Errors
   - Example: Staking 100% of ETH ($10,000) before merge
   - Impact: Complete illiquidity, missed opportunities
   - Better Approach: Max 50% staked ($5,000)
   - Real Numbers: Keep $5,000 liquid for opportunities

### Recovery Strategies
1. From FOMO Buying
   - Step 1: Document entry prices and sizes
   - Step 2: Start DCA to average down
   - Step 3: Set clear exit levels
   - Timeline: Average down over 6 months

2. From Security Issues
   - Step 1: Audit all wallet exposures
   - Step 2: Purchase hardware wallets
   - Step 3: Test small transfers first
   - Timeline: Complete migration in 7 days

3. From Overtrading
   - Step 1: Calculate total fees paid
   - Step 2: Move to cold storage
   - Step 3: Set trading limits
   - Timeline: Reduce to 20% trading allocation

### Prevention Framework
1. Entry Rules
   - Never buy after >50% pump
   - Always use limit orders
   - Split entries into 3 parts
   - Keep 10% cash for dips

2. Security Rules
   - Hardware wallet for >$5,000
   - Multiple wallet strategy
   - Regular security audits
   - Test all new procedures

3. Position Rules
   - BTC/ETH: 70-80% ($28,000-32,000)
   - Layer 1s: Max 2% each ($2,000)
   - New coins: Max 0.5% ($500)
   - Trading stack: Max 20% ($8,000)

Remember: In crypto, mistakes are amplified by volatility. Focus on security first, gains second. Your goal is to be in the market for the long term, not to get rich quick.
