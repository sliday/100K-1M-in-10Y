   - Insurance coverage

2. Protocol Parameters
   - Health factor >1.5
   - Collateral ratio <70%
   - Slippage <1%
   - Gas optimization

### Monitoring Requirements

   - APY changes
   - TVL movements
   - Protocol news

2. Weekly Review
   - Rebalancing needs
   - Gas optimization
   - Yield comparison
   - Risk assessment

## Emergency Procedures

### Quick Exit Plan
1. High Risk Events
   - Protocol breach
   - TVL crash (>30%)
   - Depeg events
   - Network issues

2. Exit Steps
   ```
   Priority Order:
   1. Withdraw lending positions
   2. Exit LP positions
   3. Bridge back to mainnet
   4. Convert to stables
   ```

### Recovery Steps
1. Asset Recovery
   - Use emergency exits
   - Multiple withdrawal paths
   - Gas reserves ready
   - Alternative networks

2. Documentation
   - Transaction hashes
   - Time stamps
   - Gas costs
   - Support tickets

## Tools Required

### Portfolio Management
1. DeFi Dashboards
   - Zapper.fi
   - DeBank
   - APY.vision
   - DeFi Llama

2. Gas Trackers
   - ETH Gas Station
   - L2fees.info
   - GasNow
   - Blocknative

### Security Tools
1. Hardware Wallet
   - Ledger Nano X
   - MetaMask integration
   - Multiple addresses
   - Regular firmware updates

2. Monitoring
   - Discord alerts
   - Twitter feeds
   - DeFi Pulse
   - CoinGecko

## Tax Considerations

### Record Keeping
1. Every Transaction
   - Entry/exit prices
   - Gas fees
   - Rewards claimed
   - IL calculations

2. Yield Tracking
   - Daily snapshots
   - APY changes
   - Reward tokens
   - Fee income

### Tax Optimization
- Hold >1 year when possible
- Harvest losses in December
- Track cost basis
- Consider IL impact

## Common Mistakes

### Core Protocol Mistakes
1. FOMO into High APYs
   - Example: Moving entire $15,000 DeFi allocation to new 1,000% APY farm
   - Impact: Potential rug pull, impermanent loss, token collapse
   - Better Approach: Max 5% ($750) for new protocols
   - Real Numbers: Limit potential loss to $750 vs $15,000

2. Ignoring IL Risk
   - Example: Providing $3,000 ETH/USDC liquidity during high volatility
   - Impact: 50% ETH pump causes 25% IL ($750 loss)
   - Better Approach: Use stable pairs for majority
   - Real Numbers: Stick to 5-8% stable yields for 80% of funds

3. Single Protocol Concentration
   - Example: Putting $10,000 in single Aave market
   - Impact: Smart contract risk exposure
   - Better Approach: Max 30% ($4,500) per protocol
   - Real Numbers: Limit potential protocol loss to $4,500

### Technical Mistakes
1. Poor Gas Management
   - Example: Claiming $50 in rewards during 200 gwei gas
   - Impact: $100 in gas fees for $50 reward
   - Better Approach: Batch claims, use L2s
   - Real Numbers: Wait for <50 gwei, save 75% on gas

2. Insufficient Monitoring
   - Example: Not checking health factor for week
   - Impact: Liquidation of $2,250 ETH position
   - Better Approach: Daily health factor checks
   - Real Numbers: Keep health factor >1.5, avoid 10% liquidation penalty

### Strategic Mistakes
1. Layer 2 Errors
   - Example: Bridging $1,500 to Arbitrum during high gas
   - Impact: $200 in bridge fees (13% loss)
   - Better Approach: Bridge during low gas, larger amounts
   - Real Numbers: Bridge $3,000, amortize $50 fee = 1.6%

2. Yield Optimization
   - Example: Moving $1,500 for 2% higher APY
   - Impact: Gas fees eat 6 months of extra yield
   - Better Approach: Move for >5% APY difference
   - Real Numbers: Need $3,000 minimum for APY hunting

### Implementation Mistakes
1. Poor Entry Timing
   - Example: Entering Curve pool right before CRV dump
   - Impact: IL + token value loss >30% ($900 on $3,000)
   - Better Approach: Scale in over 2 weeks
   - Real Numbers: Split $3,000 into 3 entries of $1,000

2. Protocol Understanding
   - Example: Using leverage without understanding liquidation
   - Impact: Quick liquidation of $1,500 position
   - Better Approach: Paper trade first, start small
   - Real Numbers: Test with $500 before scaling up

### Recovery Strategies
1. From High APY Mistakes
   - Step 1: Calculate impermanent loss
   - Step 2: Remove liquidity during low gas
   - Step 3: Move to established protocols
   - Timeline: Exit over 48 hours to minimize impact

2. From Protocol Concentration
   - Step 1: List all protocol exposures
   - Step 2: Calculate gas-efficient exit plan
   - Step 3: Redistribute across platforms
   - Timeline: Rebalance over 2 weeks

3. From Poor Monitoring
   - Step 1: Set up monitoring tools
   - Step 2: Create alert system
   - Step 3: Daily check schedule
   - Timeline: Implement within 24 hours

### Prevention Framework
1. Protocol Rules
   - Established only (>$100M TVL)
   - Multiple audits required
   - Community size check
   - Insurance availability

2. Position Rules
   - Max 30% per protocol ($4,500)
   - Max 20% per pool ($3,000)
   - Max 5% in new farms ($750)
   - Emergency fund ready ($1,500)

3. Monitoring Rules
   - Daily health checks
   - Weekly yield review
   - Monthly protocol audit
   - Quarterly strategy review

Remember: DeFi offers great yields but requires active management. Start small, understand the risks, and scale up gradually. Focus on sustainable yields over speculative gains.
