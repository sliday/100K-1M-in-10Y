# ETF Investment Strategy

An [ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund)](../chapters/glossary.md#etf) is a type of investment fund that tracks an index, sector, commodity, or other asset, but can be purchased or sold on a stock exchange the same way a regular stock can. Learn more about ETFs on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund).

## Overview
Total Allocation: 35% of portfolio ($35,000 initial + $700 monthly [DCA](../chapters/glossary.md#dca))

Our ETF strategy emphasizes broad market index funds, particularly the S&P 500, which has historically delivered strong returns while minimizing individual stock risk and management overhead. While sector ETFs can be added for targeted exposure, we recommend keeping them as smaller satellite positions.

## Core ETF Holdings (85% of ETF Portfolio)

### Broad Market Index Funds ($29,750)
1. VOO - Vanguard S&P 500 ETF
   - Allocation: 60% ($21,000)

   - Key Stats:
     * [Expense Ratio](../chapters/glossary.md#expense-ratio): 0.03%
     * Holdings: ~500
     * Broad market exposure
     * 10Y Return: ~12%
   - Why:

   - Monthly [DCA](../chapters/glossary.md#dca): $175

     * Holdings: ~3,500
     * Includes mid and small caps
     * Similar returns to S&P 500
   - Why:
     * Broader diversification
     * Small-cap exposure
     * Low correlation benefit
     * Tax efficiency

## Optional Sector Positions (15% of ETF Portfolio)

If you choose to add sector exposure, consider limiting it to 15% ($5,250) of your ETF allocation:

1. QQQ - Invesco QQQ Trust
   - Allocation: 10% ($3,500)
   - Monthly [DCA](../chapters/glossary.md#dca): $70
   - Focus: Large-cap tech
   - Higher volatility

2. SOXX - iShares Semiconductor ETF
   - Allocation: 5% ($1,750)
   - Monthly [DCA](../chapters/glossary.md#dca): $35
   - Focus: Semiconductors
   - Concentrated sector bet

> Note: Sector ETFs are optional and increase portfolio risk. Most investors can achieve their goals with just broad market index funds.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

Understanding common pitfalls helps avoid costly errors. Learn more about investment mistakes on [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/053116/10-biggest-investing-mistakes-avoid.asp).

### Core Investment Mistakes
1. Over-diversification
   - Example: Splitting $35,000 ETF allocation across 15 different ETFs
   - Impact: Each position too small to matter ($2,333 each)
   - Better Approach: Focus on core 4 ETFs (VOO, VTI, QQQ, SOXX)
   - Real Numbers: 10% position ($10,500) in VOO can grow to $42,000 in 5 years at 12% [CAGR](../chapters/glossary.md#cagr)

2. Chasing Performance
   - Example: Selling VOO ($21,000) to buy ARKK after seeing 150% yearly return
   - Impact: Buying high, selling low cycle
   - Better Approach: Stick to [DCA](../chapters/glossary.md#dca) plan ($420/month into VOO)
   - Real Numbers: Missing just 10 best days could reduce $21,000 to $14,700 over 5 years

3. Ignoring Expenses
   - Example: Choosing 3x leveraged ETFs (TQQQ) for full $35,000 allocation
   - Impact: 1% [expense ratio](../chapters/glossary.md#expense-ratio) = $350/year vs $35/year for VOO
   - Better Approach: Keep 90% in low-cost ETFs (VOO 0.03%)
   - Real Numbers: $350 saved yearly in fees = $1,960 extra in 5 years (at 10% growth)

### Trading Mistakes
1. Emotional Trading
   - Example: Panic selling QQQ ($3,500) during 20% correction
   - Impact: Locking in $700 loss instead of recovery
   - Better Approach: Follow [stop-loss](../chapters/glossary.md#stop-loss) rules (10% trailing)
   - Real Numbers: $3,500 QQQ position recovers to $4,200 in typical bounce

2. Poor Position Sizing
   - Example: Putting $20,000 (67%) of ETF allocation in ARKK
   - Impact: Excessive [volatility](../chapters/glossary.md#volatility), potential 50% drawdown = $10,000 loss
   - Better Approach: Max 15% ($4,500) in high-risk ETFs
   - Real Numbers: 15% position limits drawdown to $2,250 worst case

### Strategic Mistakes
1. Poor Tax Planning
   - Example: Trading SOXX weekly with $1,750 position
   - Impact: Short-term gains taxed at 32% vs 15% long-term
   - Better Approach: Hold core positions >1 year
   - Real Numbers: $1,000 gain = $320 tax vs $150 tax

2. Insufficient Monitoring
   - Example: Not checking ARKK position for 3 months
   - Impact: Missing -30% drop on $1,750 = $525 loss
   - Better Approach: Weekly reviews of volatile positions
   - Real Numbers: 15% stop loss limits downside to $750

### Implementation Mistakes
1. Poor Entry Timing
   - Example: Investing full $35,000 ETF allocation in one day
   - Impact: No dry powder for dips, higher average cost
   - Better Approach: 3-wave entry over 60 days
   - Real Numbers: Average 5% better entry = $1,750 saved

2. Improper Rebalancing
   - Example: Not rebalancing when VOO grows to $21,000 (60% of ETF allocation)
   - Impact: Over-concentration risk
   - Better Approach: Rebalance when position exceeds 15% ($4,500)
   - Real Numbers: Selling $5,250 to reinvest maintains risk profile

### Recovery Strategies
1. From Over-diversification
   - Step 1: List all ETF positions and their sizes
   - Step 2: Consolidate positions under $3,000
   - Step 3: Reallocate to core 4 ETFs
   - Timeline: Complete over 30 days to minimize impact

2. From Performance Chasing
   - Step 1: Document entry points and reasons
   - Step 2: Set firm exit criteria (technical or fundamental)
   - Step 3: Create rebalancing schedule
   - Timeline: Review monthly, rebalance quarterly

3. From Poor Tax Planning
   - Step 1: Identify short-term positions
   - Step 2: Hold winners until long-term
   - Step 3: Harvest losses strategically
   - Timeline: Tax planning review every December

### Prevention Framework
1. Entry Rules
   - Document every purchase reason
   - Set position size limits
   - Use DCA for consistency
   - Keep cash reserve (10%)

2. Monitoring Rules
   - Weekly performance review
   - Monthly rebalancing check
   - Quarterly tax planning
   - Annual strategy review

Remember: Most mistakes come from emotional decisions or poor planning. Stick to your system and let compound growth work for you.
