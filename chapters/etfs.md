## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Core Investment Mistakes
1. Over-diversification
   - Example: Splitting $30,000 ETF allocation across 15 different ETFs
   - Impact: Each position too small to matter ($2,000 each)
   - Better Approach: Focus on core 4 ETFs (VGT, QQQ, SOXX, ARKK)
   - Real Numbers: 10% position ($10,000) in VGT can grow to $40,000 in 5 years at 25% CAGR

2. Chasing Performance
   - Example: Selling VGT ($10,000) to buy ARKK after seeing 150% yearly return
   - Impact: Buying high, selling low cycle
   - Better Approach: Stick to DCA plan ($200/month into VGT)
   - Real Numbers: Missing just 10 best days could reduce $10,000 to $6,500 over 5 years

3. Ignoring Expenses
   - Example: Choosing 3x leveraged ETFs (TQQQ) for full $30,000 allocation
   - Impact: 1% expense ratio = $300/year vs $30/year for VGT
   - Better Approach: Keep 90% in low-cost ETFs (VGT 0.10%)
   - Real Numbers: $300 saved yearly in fees = $1,932 extra in 5 years (at 10% growth)

### Trading Mistakes
1. Emotional Trading
   - Example: Panic selling QQQ ($10,000) during 20% correction
   - Impact: Locking in $2,000 loss instead of recovery
   - Better Approach: Follow stop-loss rules (10% trailing)
   - Real Numbers: $10,000 QQQ position recovers to $12,000 in typical bounce

2. Poor Position Sizing
   - Example: Putting $20,000 (67%) of ETF allocation in ARKK
   - Impact: Excessive volatility, potential 50% drawdown = $10,000 loss
   - Better Approach: Max 15% ($4,500) in high-risk ETFs
   - Real Numbers: 15% position limits drawdown to $2,250 worst case

### Strategic Mistakes
1. Poor Tax Planning
   - Example: Trading SOXX weekly with $5,000 position
   - Impact: Short-term gains taxed at 32% vs 15% long-term
   - Better Approach: Hold core positions >1 year
   - Real Numbers: $1,000 gain = $320 tax vs $150 tax

2. Insufficient Monitoring
   - Example: Not checking ARKK position for 3 months
   - Impact: Missing -30% drop on $5,000 = $1,500 loss
   - Better Approach: Weekly reviews of volatile positions
   - Real Numbers: 15% stop loss limits downside to $750

### Implementation Mistakes
1. Poor Entry Timing
   - Example: Investing full $30,000 ETF allocation in one day
   - Impact: No dry powder for dips, higher average cost
   - Better Approach: 3-wave entry over 60 days
   - Real Numbers: Average 5% better entry = $1,500 saved

2. Improper Rebalancing
   - Example: Not rebalancing when VGT grows to $15,000 (50% of ETF allocation)
   - Impact: Over-concentration risk
   - Better Approach: Rebalance when position exceeds 15% ($4,500)
   - Real Numbers: Selling $5,000 to reinvest maintains risk profile

### Recovery Strategies
1. From Over-diversification
   - Step 1: List all ETF positions and their sizes
   - Step 2: Consolidate positions under $3,000
   - Step 3: Reallocate to core 4 ETFs
   - Timeline: Complete over 30 days to minimize impact

2. From Performance Chasing
   - Step 1: Document entry points and reasons
   - Step 2: Set firm exit criteria (technical or fundamental)
   - Step 3: Create rebalancing schedule
   - Timeline: Review monthly, rebalance quarterly

3. From Poor Tax Planning
   - Step 1: Identify short-term positions
   - Step 2: Hold winners until long-term
   - Step 3: Harvest losses strategically
   - Timeline: Tax planning review every December

### Prevention Framework
1. Entry Rules
   - Document every purchase reason
   - Set position size limits
   - Use DCA for consistency
   - Keep cash reserve (10%)

2. Monitoring Rules
   - Weekly performance review
   - Monthly rebalancing check
   - Quarterly tax planning
   - Annual strategy review

Remember: Most mistakes come from emotional decisions or poor planning. Stick to your system and let compound growth work for you.
