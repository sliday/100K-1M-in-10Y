## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Strategy Errors
1. Yield Chasing
   - Example: Moving $3,000 to risky bonds for 2% higher yield
   - Impact: Increased default risk
   - Better Approach: Maintain barbell balance
   - Real Numbers: Max 5% in high-yield bonds

2. Duration Risk
   - Example: All $4,000 in long-term Treasuries
   - Impact: High interest rate sensitivity
   - Better Approach: Ladder maturities
   - Real Numbers: Max $2,000 per duration bucket

### Implementation Mistakes
1. Poor Diversification
   - Example: $3,000 in single corporate bond
   - Impact: High issuer risk
   - Better Approach: Max $2,000 per issuer
   - Real Numbers: Split $3,000 across min. 3 issuers

2. Timing Errors
   - Example: Rushing to lock in high rates
   - Impact: Missed better opportunities
   - Better Approach: Ladder entry points
   - Real Numbers: Split $3,000 CD over 3 months
