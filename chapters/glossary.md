2. APY (Annual Percentage Yield)
   - Definition: Actual return rate including compound interest
   - Example: DeFi lending target of 4-6% APY on $8,000 allocation
   - Usage: "Aave lending at 4.5% APY on $4,000 USDC position"

3. TVL (Total Value Locked)
   - Definition: Total assets deposited in a protocol
   - Example: Minimum $1B TVL requirement for DeFi platforms
   - Usage: "Aave has $5B TVL, meeting our security threshold"

### Portfolio Management
1. Rebalancing
   - Definition: Adjusting positions back to target allocations
   - Example: ETF portion growing from 30% ($30,000) to 35% ($35,000)
   - Action: "Sell $5,000 of ETFs to return to 30% allocation"

2. Position Sizing
   - Definition: Determining amount to allocate to each investment
   - Example: VGT allocation of 10% ($10,000) of total portfolio
   - Rule: "No single ETF position exceeds $10,000 (10%)"

3. Stop Loss
   - Definition: Automatic sell trigger at predetermined price
   - Example: -15% trailing stop on $5,000 SOXX position
   - Action: "Sell if SOXX drops 15% from peak ($4,250)"

## Trading Terminology

### Order Types
1. Market Order
   - Definition: Buy/sell immediately at current price
   - Example: Buying $10,000 of QQQ at market
   - Usage: "When DCAing monthly $600 into ETFs"

2. Limit Order
   - Definition: Buy/sell only at specified price or better
   - Example: Buy $2,000 BTC at $40,000
   - Usage: "Setting buys 5% below market for monthly crypto DCA"

3. Stop-Market Order
   - Definition: Becomes market order when stop price hit
   - Example: Sell $3,000 SOL if price drops to $80
   - Usage: "Protection for Layer 1 crypto positions"

### Risk Metrics
1. Sharpe Ratio
   - Definition: Return per unit of risk (volatility)
   - Example: Portfolio target Sharpe ratio >1.5
   - Usage: "ETF portion maintains 1.8 Sharpe ratio"

2. Maximum Drawdown
   - Definition: Largest peak-to-trough decline
   - Example: 35% max drawdown tolerance on $100,000
   - Usage: "Stop loss triggers at $65,000 portfolio value"

3. Beta
   - Definition: Volatility compared to market
   - Example: ETF portfolio beta of 1.2 vs S&P 500
   - Usage: "Higher beta for aggressive growth target"

## DeFi Concepts

### Yield Generation
1. Liquidity Providing

   - Example: $4,000 in Curve plus CRV rewards
   - Strategy: "Stack base yields with protocol rewards"

3. Liquid Staking

   - Example: $2,000 in Lido stETH
   - Usage: "Earn staking yields while maintaining tradability"

### Platform Mechanics
1. Health Factor

## Tax Terms

   - Impact: "$1,000 gain on $2,000 investment"

2. Tax-Loss Harvesting

   - Example: Selling $5,000 ARKK position at 20% loss
   - Benefit: "$1,000 loss offsets other gains"

3. Cost Basis
   - Definition: Original investment amount
   - Example: $10,000 initial VGT purchase
   - Tracking: "Record each buy with date and amount"

### Advanced Concepts

   - Strategy: "Consider relocation for 0% crypto gains"

## Risk Management

1. Correlation
   - Definition: Price movement relationships
   - Example: BTC/ETH correlation > 0.8

   - Example: Crypto volatility 3x higher than ETFs
   - Management: "Higher allocation to less volatile assets"

3. Liquidity
   - Definition: Ease of buying/selling

   - Rule: "Position size < 1% of asset's daily volume"

### Emergency Procedures
