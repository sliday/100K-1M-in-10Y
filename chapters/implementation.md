## Common Setup Mistakes

### Security Errors
1. Rushing Setup
   - Example: Deploying $40,000 to crypto before testing withdrawals
   - Impact: Potential loss of funds if addresses are wrong
   - Better Approach: Test with $100, then $1,000, then full amount
   - Real Numbers: 3 test transactions before moving $10,000+

2. Poor Backup Management
   - Example: Single backup for $100,000 portfolio
   - Impact: Complete loss if backup is compromised
   - Better Approach: 3 secure locations, $33,333 each
   - Real Numbers: Test recovery monthly with $100

### Deployment Errors
1. Over-Allocation
   - Example: Investing full $30,000 ETF allocation at once
   - Impact: Poor entry prices, missed opportunities
   - Better Approach: 3 tranches of $10,000 each
   - Real Numbers: 40% immediate, 30% at 5% dip, 30% at 10% dip

2. Platform Risk
   - Example: Keeping entire $40,000 crypto allocation on exchange
   - Impact: Exchange risk, potential loss
   - Better Approach: Max $8,000 (20%) on any exchange
   - Real Numbers: Move every $5,000 to cold storage
