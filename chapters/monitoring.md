## Common Monitoring Mistakes

### Tracking Errors
1. Inconsistent Monitoring
   - Example: Checking $40,000 crypto allocation randomly
   - Impact: Missed 15% drop, $6,000 loss
   - Better Approach: Set schedule (9am, 5pm)
   - Real Numbers: Each $10,000 position checked twice daily

2. Poor Record Keeping
   - Example: Not tracking gas fees on $15,000 DeFi allocation
   - Impact: Missed $500 in fees over month
   - Better Approach: Log every transaction
   - Real Numbers: Even $20 gas fees matter

### Risk Management Errors
1. Ignored Warnings
   - Example: Not acting on 5% ETF deviation ($1,500)
   - Impact: Grew to 15% ($4,500) imbalance
   - Better Approach: Act at 5% threshold
   - Real Numbers: Rebalance at $1,500 deviation

2. Correlation Blindness
   - Example: All Layer 1s ($10,000) moving together
   - Impact: 30% synchronized drop ($3,000)
   - Better Approach: Daily correlation check
   - Real Numbers: Alert if >0.8 correlation
