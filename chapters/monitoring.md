## Common Monitoring Mistakes

### Tracking Errors
1. Inconsistent Monitoring
   - Example: Checking $32,000 crypto allocation randomly
   - Impact: Missed 15% drop, $4,800 loss
   - Better Approach: Set schedule (9am, 5pm)
   - Real Numbers: Each $8,000 position checked twice daily

2. Poor Record Keeping
   - Example: Not tracking reinvested interest on $24,000 fixed income
   - Impact: Missed $200 in monthly income
   - Better Approach: Log every payment and reinvestment
   - Real Numbers: Even $20 interest payments matter

### Risk Management Errors
1. Ignored Warnings
   - Example: Not acting on 5% ETF deviation ($1,200)
   - Impact: Grew to 15% ($3,600) imbalance
   - Better Approach: Act at 5% threshold
   - Real Numbers: Rebalance at $1,200 deviation

2. Correlation Blindness
   - Example: All Layer 1s ($8,000) moving together
   - Impact: 30% synchronized drop ($2,400)
   - Better Approach: Daily correlation check
   - Real Numbers: Alert if >0.8 correlation

3. Duration Oversight
   - Example: Not monitoring bond portfolio duration
   - Impact: 2% loss on 50bp rate move ($480)
   - Better Approach: Weekly duration check
   - Real Numbers: Keep duration under 7 years
