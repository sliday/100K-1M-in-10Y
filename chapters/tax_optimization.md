## Overview
This chapter details tax optimization strategies for the $100k portfolio, focusing on minimizing tax impact while maximizing after-tax returns.

## Tax Classification Matrix
```
Asset Type | Holding Period | Tax Treatment | Example
ETFs       | >1 year       | LTCG (15%)    | VGT held 400 days
Crypto     | >1 year       | LTCG (15%)    | BTC held 380 days
DeFi Yield | Any           | Income        | Aave interest
Staking    | Any           | Income        | ETH2 rewards
Trading    | <1 year       | STCG          | Alt-L1 trades

Tax Rate Brackets (2023):
Income Level    | STCG Rate | LTCG Rate
$0-44,625      | 10-12%    | 0%
$44,626-492,300| 22-35%    | 15%
>$492,300      | 37%       | 20%
```

   Asset    | Strategy      | Tax Impact
   VTI     | Buy & Hold    | Defer gains
   VXUS    | Loss Harvest  | Offset gains
   SOXX    | Rebalance    | Minimize churn

2. Crypto Core ($40,000):
   Asset    | Strategy      | Tax Impact
   BTC     | >1yr hold     | LTCG rate
   ETH     | >1yr hold     | LTCG rate

   Asset    | Strategy      | Tax Impact
   Alt-L1s | Selective     | Mix LTCG/STCG
   DeFi    | Yield focus   | Income rates
```

## Tax Loss Harvesting
```
Harvesting Rules:
1. 30-day wash sale window
2. Minimum 5% loss threshold
3. Similar exposure maintenance
4. Documentation requirements

Example Trades:
Original    | Loss Trade    | Replacement
VGT $10,000 | -$1,000 loss | VUG $9,000
SOXX $5,000 | -$500 loss   | SMH $4,500
DOT $3,000  | -$600 loss   | KSM $2,400

Annual Target:
Harvest $3,000-5,000 in losses
Offset $3,000 ordinary income
Bank remaining for future gains
```

## DeFi Tax Management
```
1. Yield Strategies:
   Protocol | Treatment | Documentation
   Aave     | Interest  | Daily rates
   Curve    | Income    | Weekly claims
   Staking  | Rewards   | Monthly totals

2. Gas Optimization:
   Action         | Strategy        | Tax Impact
   Claim rewards  | Batch >$500    | Deduct fees
   Pool exits     | Time gas fees  | Cost basis
   Rebalancing    | Minimize swaps | Reduce events
```

## Documentation Requirements
```
1. Transaction Records:
   □ Date and time
   □ Buy/sell prices
   □ Fees paid
   □ Platform used
   □ Purpose of trade

2. Cost Basis Tracking:
   □ Purchase date
   □ Acquisition price
   □ Fee inclusion
   □ Basis method (FIFO)
   □ Holding period

3. Income Records:
   □ Yield earnings
   □ Staking rewards
   □ Mining income
   □ Airdrops
   □ Fork proceeds
```

## Tax Calendar
```
Monthly Tasks:
□ Update transaction log
□ Calculate yield income
□ Review harvest opportunities
□ Document cost basis

Quarterly Tasks:
□ Estimate tax liability
□ Plan harvesting trades
□ Review asset location
□ Update projections

Annual Tasks (December):
□ Harvest remaining losses
□ Rebalance positions
□ Calculate total liability
□ Prepare tax documents
```

## Common Mistakes
```
1. Wash Sale Violations
   Example: Selling VGT at loss, buying VUG within 30 days
   Impact: Loss disallowed, higher tax bill
   Solution: Wait 31 days or buy non-similar fund

2. Missing Cost Basis
   Example: Lost records of DeFi trades
   Impact: Full amount taxed as gain
   Solution: Keep detailed logs of all transactions

3. Incorrect Classification
   Example: Reporting staking as capital gains
   Impact: IRS audit risk, penalties
   Solution: Proper income vs. capital classification
```
